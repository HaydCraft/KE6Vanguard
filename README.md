# KE6 Vanguard

KE6 Vanguard are the esports team for King Edward VI College in Nuneaton. They specialise in Rocket League, League of Legends, Overwatch, and Valorant.

This website was a great introduction to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for me, and allowed me to play around with building layouts, styling elements, and experimenting with interactivity.
